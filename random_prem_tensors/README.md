# Random Permutation of Integers

Contains pickled PyTorch Tensors (of 10k, 50k, 100k, 250k and 500k elements) generated using [torch.randperm](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.save.html) in 10 sets.

These are intended to be used for shuffling tensors in a similar way to that described in this [blog post](https://kierenaw.github.io/blog/2021/09/22/shuffle_two_pytorch_tensors_the_same_way.html).
